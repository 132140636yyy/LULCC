This repository hosts the main code for generating the results for “Shifts in Local Water Availability due to Land Use and Land Cover Change based on Past 29 years Observation Data”.

There are three folders under this repository:
1.Input datasets for the procedures.
2.DE_LULCC presents the procedure for the definition of LULCC classes based on CCI satellite dataset. 
3.ST_APPR presents the space-for-time approximation method for isolating the LULCC impacts on precipitation and evapotranspiration.
